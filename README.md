## Directions For Future Development

- Create more quests and develop the game environments more.
- Use it as a storyboard to showcase how we progressed through our Bootcamp journey
- Include quests geared towards practicing whiteboard interview questions.
- freeCodeCamp has a huge section for that. We can use our app to gamify their interview section and try to integrate it with their api. (Great for showing we contribute open source and also some publicity that might help with job search)
